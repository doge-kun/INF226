Question 1:
Assume the following shared variables:

int x, y, z;

Split the following program into blocks of code that appear atomic. Is your subdivision unique?

x = 0; write
y = y + 1; read, write
int a = x + y; read, read
a = a * 100; appear atomic
a = sin(a); appear atomic
z = a; write


Question 2
For each of the cases below:

    analyze whether each concurrent process has the amo-property.
    decide whether the processes are interfering or not.

Assume that x == y == 0 are shared variables, r local.

    co x = x + 1; || y = x + 1; oc		//x: read, write | y: read, write | x interferes with y
    co x = y + 1; || y = x + 1; oc		//x: read from y and writes to x | y: reads from x and writes to y | inteference
    co x = y + 1; || x = y + 3; || y = 1; oc	//x: read from y and write to x | x: read from y and write to x | y: writes to y | interference 
    co x = y + 1; || r = y - 1; || y = 5; oc	//first process reads from y which is written to by third process | interferenceI

Answer the following questions:

    After co r = x - x; || p1; || ... || pn; oc, is r == 0?	//No, cause other processes can alter the value of x before the first process can read

    Are these two programs the same?				//No, same reason as above
        co x = x; || p1; || ... || pn; oc
        co p1; || ... || pn; oc


Question 3
Assume shared variables int a = 0, b = 0; and these two concurrently running programs:

a = 1;
if (b == 0) { cout << "A"; }

b = 1;
if (a == 0) { cout << "B"; }

How many (fine-grained) atomic operations to the shared variables do each of the two processes have? We assume here that blocks that do printing are atomic (which of course is not the case).
//Process one writes to a and reads from b
//Process two writes to b and reads from a
//If printing is atomic as well, both processes will have 3 atomic operations

How many possible sequential consistent interleavings are there for these operations? Can you list them?
//20 (look at model in notes1). No I cant list them

How many possible interleavings are there  for those operations? Can you list them?
//362880 (look at model in notes1). No I cant and I wont.

What are the possible outcomes of the program in a typical modern computer?
//I dont know
